\begin{abstract}
The current standard for medium access control in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), is by its nature prone to collisions. These happen as a consequence of randomizing the backoff counter each contender must select in order to coordinate its transmissions. Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Enhanced Collision Avoidance (CSMA/ECA) introduces minor adjustments to CSMA/CA  that eliminate the possibility of collisions after a short convergence period. Its principle is to select a deterministic backoff after successful transmissions instead of a random one (as in CSMA/CA), allowing contenders to \emph{own} a time slot in the schedule. Simulation results show an important increase in the offered throughput as well as the number of contenders that can me allocated in a collision-free fashion.
